Goals
-----

The BDS movement aims to achieve several key goals, all centered around securing what it considers to be fundamental rights for Palestinians under international law. These goals include:

1. **Achieving Palestinian Rights**: The BDS movement seeks to ensure that Palestinians receive their rights as outlined in international law. These rights include:
   - Israel's withdrawal from occupied territories
   - Dismantling of separation barriers
   - Guaranteeing equal rights for Palestinian citizens of Israel
   - Respecting the right of return for Palestinian refugees

Methods
-------

To accomplish its objectives, the BDS movement employs three primary tactics:

1. **Boycotts**: This tactic involves boycotting Israeli products, brands, and businesses. The movement encourages individuals and organizations to refrain from engaging with these entities entirely.
2. **Divestment**: The BDS movement targets institutions such as universities, pension funds, and banks, urging them to divest from companies that support Israeli policies perceived as unjust toward Palestinians.
3. **Sanctions**: Advocates of BDS call for governments to impose economic sanctions on Israel, similar to those implemented against South Africa during apartheid.

Origins and Inspiration
------------------------

Launched in 2005 by Palestinian civil society groups, the BDS movement draws inspiration from the successful anti-apartheid movement in South Africa. Supporters of BDS see parallels between the historical oppression of Black South Africans and the treatment of Palestinians by Israel. The movement views economic pressure as a powerful tool for achieving justice and equality.

Criticisms and Controversies
-----------------------------

The BDS movement is a highly contentious topic, evoking diverse reactions from various quarters. While some view it as a legitimate form of non-violent protest against perceived injustices, others criticize it for being discriminatory or even anti-Semitic. Critics argue that BDS unfairly targets `israel product <https://www.emzeth.com/en/israel-product-checker/>`_ and undermines its right to exist as a sovereign state. However, supporters of BDS vehemently deny these accusations, emphasizing their commitment to universal human rights principles and their opposition to all forms of discrimination.

In conclusion, the BDS movement represents a significant aspect of the ongoing Israeli-Palestinian conflict, with proponents and detractors engaging in robust debate over its efficacy, morality, and impact on the pursuit of peace and justice in the region.
